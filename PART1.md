## Problems Encountered & Solutions

Describe the problems encountered and provide the solutions / plan for the solutions.
1. Couldn't display the column number properly when its more than 10.
Solution: Seperated the 2nd row of the column number and assign it to a vector, then print it out after end line.
2. Couldn't accurately pin-point the location of individual elements inside the 2d vector (before lab11 was even out)
Solution: Scrapped the whole code and redo the whole code following the examples shown in lab11.
